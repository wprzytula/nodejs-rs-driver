/// - a `pub(crate)` `build_*` function that constructs a new instance of that class directly,
///   given the constructor arguments.
///
/// A single OS thread can host multiple, independent N-API environments, so the registry
/// is keyed by `napi_env` to avoid collisions between them.
///
/// The registry must be a single, static `HashMap<usize, FunctionRef<...>>`, so its value type
/// must be fixed once and for all at compile time. But `$args_ty` (the constructor's argument
/// type) is often borrowed, and that lifetime `'a` belongs to one specific call to `$build_fn`,
/// not to the `'static` registry. So we cannot store `FunctionRef<$args_ty, ()>` directly.
/// Instead, the registry stores every constructor's `FunctionRef` under the same erased
/// `Function<(), ()>` type, regardless of the class's real constructor signature, so that a single
/// `HashMap<usize, FunctionRef<(), ()>>` can hold `FunctionRef`s for all classes defined with
/// this macro. Erasing the `Args` type here means we now need to re-tag the constructor's
/// phantom `Args` type parameter back to this call's real (possibly borrowed) argument type
/// before we can call it with real arguments.
///
/// To cache the `FunctionRef` for each environment, we erase the `Args` type parameter to `()`
/// (`register_fn`'s parameter is `Function<(), ()>`). `Function::new_instance` takes the exact
/// same `Args` type the `Function` handle was typed with, so we re-tag it to the call's real
/// argument type via `Function::from_napi_value`.
///
/// The `Return` type parameter of the underlying `Function`/`FunctionRef` is always ignored: it is
/// only used by `Function::call`, but we always construct instances with `Function::new_instance`,
/// so we set it to arbitrary `()`.
